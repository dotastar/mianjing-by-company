C/C++ Interview Questions

how do you find out if a linked-list has an end? (i.e. the list is not a 
cycle)

You can find out by using 2 pointers. One of them goes 2 nodes each time. 
The second one goes at 1 nodes each time. If there is a cycle, the one that 
goes 2 nodes each time will eventually meet the one that goes slower. If 
that is the case, then you will know the linked-list is a cycle.

What is the difference between realloc() and free()?

The free subroutine frees a block of memory previously allocated by the 
malloc subroutine. Undefined results occur if the Pointer parameter is not a
valid pointer. If the Pointer parameter is a null value, no action will 
occur. The realloc subroutine changes the size of the block of memory 
pointed to by the Pointer parameter to the number of bytes specified by the 
Size parameter and returns a new pointer to the block. The pointer specified
by the Pointer parameter must have been created with the malloc, calloc, or
realloc subroutines and not been deallocated with the free or realloc 
subroutines. Undefined results occur if the Pointer parameter is not a valid
pointer.

What is function overloading and operator overloading?

Function overloading: C++ enables several functions of the same name to be 
defined, as long as these functions have different sets of parameters (at 
least as far as their types are concerned). This capability is called 
function overloading. When an overloaded function is called, the C++ 
compiler selects the proper function by examining the number, types and 
order of the arguments in the call. Function overloading is commonly used to
create several functions of the same name that perform similar tasks but on
different data types.

Operator overloading allows existing C++ operators to be redefined so that 
they work on objects of user-defined classes. Overloaded operators are 
syntactic sugar for equivalent function calls. They form a pleasant facade 
that doesn’t add anything fundamental to the language (but they can improve
understandability and reduce maintenance costs).

What is the difference between declaration and definition?

The declaration tells the compiler that at some later point we plan to 
present the definition of this declaration.
E.g.: void stars () //function declaration
The definition contains the actual implementation.
E.g.: void stars () // declarator
{
for(int j=10; j > =0; jC) //function body
cout << *;
cout <<>

What are the advantages of inheritance?

It permits code reusability. Reusability saves time in program development. 
It encourages the reuse of proven and debugged high-quality software, thus 
reducing problem after a system becomes functional.

How do you write a function that can reverse a linked-list?

void reverselist(void)
{
if(head==0)
return;
if(head->next==0)
return;
if(head->next==tail)
{
head->next = 0;
tail->next = head;
}
else
{
node* pre = head;
node* cur = head->next;
node* curnext = cur->next;
head->next = 0;
cur-> next = head;

for(; curnext!=0; )
{
cur->next = pre;
pre = cur;
cur = curnext;
curnext = curnext->next;
}
curnext->next = cur;
}
}

What do you mean by inline function?

The idea behind inline functions is to insert the code of a called function 
at the point where the function is called. If done carefully, this can 
improve the application’s performance in exchange for increased compile 
time and possibly (but not always) an increase in the size of the generated 
binary executables.

Write a program that ask for user input from 5 to 9 then calculate the 
average

#include “iostream.h”
int main() {
int MAX = 4;
int total = 0;
int average;
int numb;
for (int i=0; icout << “Please enter your input between 5 and 9: “;
cin >> numb;
while ( numb<5>9) {
cout << “Invalid input, please re-enter: “;
cin >> numb;
}
total = total + numb;
}
average = total/MAX;
cout << “The average number is: ” <<>return 0;
}

What is public, protected, private?

    * Public, protected and private are three access specifiers in C++.
    * Public data members and member functions are accessible outside the 
class.
    * Protected data members and member functions are only available to 
derived classes.
    * Private data members and member functions can’t be accessed outside 
the class. However there is an exception can be using friend classes.

Write a function that swaps the values of two integers, using int* as the 
argument type.
void swap(int* a, int*b) {
int t;
t = *a;
*a = *b;
*b = t;
}

Tell how to check whether a linked list is circular.

Create two pointers, each set to the start of the list. Update each as 
follows:
while (pointer1) {
pointer1 = pointer1->next;
pointer2 = pointer2->next; if (pointer2) pointer2=pointer2->next;
if (pointer1 == pointer2) {
print (\”circular\n\”);
}
}

OK, why does this work?
If a list is circular, at some point pointer2 will wrap around and be either
at the item just before pointer1, or the item before that. Either way, it’
s either 1 or 2 jumps until they meet.

What is polymorphism?

Polymorphism is the idea that a base class can be inherited by several 
classes. A base class pointer can point to its child class and a base class 
array can store different child class objects.

What is virtual constructors/destructors?

Answer1
Virtual destructors:
If an object (with a non-virtual destructor) is destroyed explicitly by 
applying the delete operator to a base-class pointer to the object, the base
-class destructor function (matching the pointer type) is called on the 
object.
There is a simple solution to this problem declare a virtual base-class 
destructor.
This makes all derived-class destructors virtual even though they don’t 
have the same name as the base-class destructor. Now, if the object in the 
hierarchy is destroyed explicitly by applying the delete operator to a base-
class pointer to a derived-class object, the destructor for the appropriate 
class is called. Virtual constructor: Constructors cannot be virtual. 
Declaring a constructor as a virtual function is a syntax error.

Does c++ support multilevel and multiple inheritance?
Yes.

What are the advantages of inheritance?
? It permits code reusability.
? Reusability saves time in program development.
? It encourages the reuse of proven and debugged high-quality software
, thus reducing problem after a system becomes functional.
What is the difference between declaration and definition?
The declaration tells the compiler that at some later point we plan to 
present the definition of this declaration.
E.g.: void stars () //function declaration
The definition contains the actual implementation.
E.g.: void stars () // declarator
{
for(int j=10; j>=0; jC) //function body
cout<<”*”;
cout<
What is the difference between an ARRAY and a LIST?

Answer1
Array is collection of homogeneous elements.
List is collection of heterogeneous elements.

For Array memory allocated is static and continuous.
For List memory allocated is dynamic and Random.

Array: User need not have to keep in track of next memory allocation.
List: User has to keep in Track of next location where memory is allocated.

Answer2
Array uses direct access of stored members, list uses sequencial access for 
members.

//With Array you have direct access to memory position 5
Object x = a[5]; // x takes directly a reference to 5th element of array

//With the list you have to cross all previous nodes in order to get the 5th
node:
list mylist;
list::iterator it;

for( it = list.begin() ; it != list.end() ; it++ )
{
if( i==5)
{
x = *it;
break;
}
i++;
}

What is a template?

Templates allow to create generic functions that admit any data type as 
parameters and return value without having to overload the function with all
the possible data types. Until certain point they fulfill the functionality
of a macro. Its prototype is any of the two following ones:

template function_declaration; template function_declaration;

The only difference between both prototypes is the use of keyword class or 
typename, its use is indistinct since both expressions have exactly the same
meaning and behave exactly the same way.

You have two pairs: new() and delete() and another pair : alloc() and free()
. Explain differences between eg. new() and malloc()

Answer1
1.) “new and delete” are preprocessors while “malloc() and free()” are 
functions. [we dont use brackets will calling new or delete].
2.) no need of allocate the memory while using “new” but in “malloc()” 
we have to use “sizeof()”.
3.) “new” will initlize the new memory to 0 but “malloc()” gives random 
value in the new alloted memory location [better to use calloc()]

Answer2
new() allocates continous space for the object instace
malloc() allocates distributed space.
new() is castless, meaning that allocates memory for this specific type,
malloc(), calloc() allocate space for void * that is cated to the specific 
class type pointer.

What is the difference between class and structure?

Structure: Initially (in C) a structure was used to bundle different type of
data types together to perform a particular functionality. But C++ extended
the structure to contain functions also. The major difference is that all 
declarations inside a structure are by default public.
Class: Class is a successor of Structure. By default all the members inside 
the class are private.

What is RTTI?

Runtime type identification (RTTI) lets you find the dynamic type of an 
object when you have only a pointer or a reference to the base type. RTTI is
the official way in standard C++ to discover the type of an object and to 
convert the type of a pointer or reference (that is, dynamic typing). The 
need came from practical experience with C++. RTTI replaces many homegrown 
versions with a solid, consistent approach.

What is encapsulation?

Packaging an object’s variables within its methods is called encapsulation.

Explain term POLIMORPHISM and give an example using eg. SHAPE object: If I 
have a base class SHAPE, how would I define DRAW methods for two objects 
CIRCLE and SQUARE

Answer1
POLYMORPHISM : A phenomenon which enables an object to react differently to 
the same function call.
in C++ it is attained by using a keyword virtual

Example
public class SHAPE
{
public virtual void SHAPE::DRAW()=0;
}
Note here the function DRAW() is pure virtual which means the sub classes 
must implement the DRAW() method and SHAPE cannot be instatiated

public class CIRCLE::public SHAPE
{
public void CIRCLE::DRAW()
{
// TODO drawing circle
}
}
public class SQUARE::public SHAPE
{
public void SQUARE::DRAW()
{
// TODO drawing square
}
}
now from the user class the calls would be like
globally
SHAPE *newShape;

When user action is to draw
public void MENU::OnClickDrawCircle(){
newShape = new CIRCLE();
}

public void MENU::OnClickDrawCircle(){
newShape = new SQUARE();
}

the when user actually draws
public void CANVAS::OnMouseOperations(){
newShape->DRAW();
}

Answer2
class SHAPE{
public virtual Draw() = 0; //abstract class with a pure virtual method
};

class CIRCLE{
public int r;
public virtual Draw() { this->drawCircle(0,0,r); }
};

class SQURE
public int a;
public virtual Draw() { this->drawRectangular(0,0,a,a); }
};

Each object is driven down from SHAPE implementing Draw() function in its 
own way.

What is an object?

Object is a software bundle of variables and related methods. Objects have 
state and behavior.

How can you tell what shell you are running on UNIX system?

You can do the Echo $RANDOM. It will return a undefined variable if you are 
from the C-Shell, just a return prompt if you are from the Bourne shell, and
a 5 digit random numbers if you are from the Korn shell. You could also do 
a ps -l and look for the shell with the highest PID.

Describe PRIVATE, PROTECTED and PUBLIC C the differences and give examples.

class Point2D{
int x; int y;
public int color;
protected bool pinned;
public Point2D() : x(0) , y(0) {} //default (no argument) constructor
};
Point2D MyPoint;
You cannot directly access private data members when they are declared (
implicitly) private:
MyPoint.x = 5; // Compiler will issue a compile ERROR
//Nor yoy can see them:
int x_dim = MyPoint.x; // Compiler will issue a compile ERROR
On the other hand, you can assign and read the public data members:
MyPoint.color = 255; // no problem
int col = MyPoint.color; // no problem
With protected data members you can read them but not write them: MyPoint.
pinned = true; // Compiler will issue a compile ERROR
bool isPinned = MyPoint.pinned; // no problem

What is namespace?

Namespaces allow us to group a set of global classes, objects and/or 
functions under a name. To say it somehow, they serve to split the global 
scope in sub-scopes known as namespaces.
The form to use namespaces is:
namespace identifier { namespace-body }
Where identifier is any valid identifier and namespace-body is the set of 
classes, objects and functions that are included within the namespace. For 
example:
namespace general { int a, b; } In this case, a and b are normal variables 
integrated within the general namespace. In order to access to these 
variables from outside the namespace we have to use the scope operator ::. 
For example, to access the previous variables we would have to put:
general::a general::b
The functionality of namespaces is specially useful in case that there is a 
possibility that a global object or function can have the same name than 
another one, causing a redefinition error.

What do you mean by inheritance?

Inheritance is the process of creating new classes, called derived classes, 
from existing classes or base classes. The derived class inherits all the 
capabilities of the base class, but can add embellishments and refinements 
of its own.

What is a COPY CONSTRUCTOR and when is it called?

A copy constructor is a method that accepts an object of the same class and 
copies it’s data members to the object on the left part of assignement:
class Point2D{
int x; int y;
public int color;
protected bool pinned;
public Point2D() : x(0) , y(0) {} //default (no argument) constructor
public Point2D( const Point2D & ) ;
};
Point2D::Point2D( const Point2D & p )
{
this->x = p.x;
this->y = p.y;
this->color = p.color;
this->pinned = p.pinned;
}
main(){
Point2D MyPoint;
MyPoint.color = 345;
Point2D AnotherPoint = Point2D( MyPoint ); // now AnotherPoint has color = 
345

What is Boyce Codd Normal form?

A relation schema R is in BCNF with respect to a set F of functional 
dependencies if for all functional dependencies in F+ of the form a-> , 
where a and b is a subset of R, at least one of the following holds:
* a- > b is a trivial functional dependency (b is a subset of a)
* a is a superkey for schema R

What is virtual class and friend class?

Friend classes are used when two or more classes are designed to work 
together and need access to each other’s implementation in ways that the 
rest of the world shouldn’t be allowed to have. In other words, they help 
keep private things private. For instance, it may be desirable for class 
DatabaseCursor to have more privilege to the internals of class Database 
than main() has.

What is the word you will use when defining a function in base class to 
allow this function to be a polimorphic function?

virtual

What do you mean by binding of data and functions?

Encapsulation.

What are 2 ways of exporting a function from a DLL?

1.Taking a reference to the function from the DLL instance.
2. Using the DLL ’s Type Library.

What is the difference between an object and a class?

Classes and objects are separate but related concepts. Every object belongs 
to a class and every class contains one or more related objects.
- A Class is static. All of the attributes of a class are fixed before, 
during, and after the execution of a program. The attributes of a class don
’t change.
- The class to which an object belongs is also (usually) static. If a 
particular object belongs to a certain class at the time that it is created 
then it almost certainly will still belong to that class right up until the 
time that it is destroyed.
- An Object on the other hand has a limited lifespan. Objects are created 
and eventually destroyed. Also during that lifetime, the attributes of the 
object may undergo significant change.

Suppose that data is an array of 1000 integers. Write a single function call
that will sort the 100 elements data [222] through data [321].

quicksort ((data + 222), 100);

What is a class?

Class is a user-defined data type in C++. It can be created to solve a 
particular kind of problem. After creation the user need not know the 
specifics of the working of a class.

What is friend function?

As the name suggests, the function acts as a friend to a class. As a friend 
of a class, it can access its private and protected members. A friend 
function is not a member of the class. But it must be listed in the class 
definition.

Which recursive sorting technique always makes recursive calls to sort 
subarrays that are about half size of the original array?

Mergesort always makes recursive calls to sort subarrays that are about half
size of the original array, resulting in O(n log n) time.

What is abstraction?

Abstraction is of the process of hiding unwanted details from the user.

What are virtual functions?

A virtual function allows derived classes to replace the implementation 
provided by the base class. The compiler makes sure the replacement is 
always called whenever the object in question is actually of the derived 
class, even if the object is accessed by a base pointer rather than a 
derived pointer. This allows algorithms in the base class to be replaced in 
the derived class, even if users don’t know about the derived class.

What is the difference between an external iterator and an internal iterator
? Describe an advantage of an external iterator.

An internal iterator is implemented with member functions of the class that 
has items to step through. .An external iterator is implemented as a 
separate class that can be “attach” to the object that has items to step 
through. .An external iterator has the advantage that many difference 
iterators can be active simultaneously on the same object.

What is a scope resolution operator?

A scope resolution operator (::), can be used to define the member functions
of a class outside the class.

What do you mean by pure virtual functions?

A pure virtual member function is a member function that the base class 
forces derived classes to provide. Normally these member functions have no 
implementation. Pure virtual functions are equated to zero.

class Shape { public: virtual void draw() = 0; };

What is polymorphism? Explain with an example?

“Poly” means “many” and “morph” means “form”. Polymorphism is the 
ability of an object (or reference) to assume (be replaced by) or become 
many different forms of object.
Example: function overloading, function overriding, virtual functions. 
Another example can be a plus ‘+’ sign, used for adding two integers or 
for using it to concatenate two strings.

How can you quickly find the number of elements stored in a a) static array 
b) dynamic array ?
Why is it difficult to store linked list in an array?
How can you find the nodes with repetetive data in a linked list?

Write a prog to accept a given string in any order and flash error if any of
the character is different. For example : If abc is the input then abc, bca
, cba, cab bac are acceptable but aac or bcd are unacceptable.
Write out a function that prints out all the permutations of a string. For 
example, abc would give you abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba. You can assume 
that all the characters will be unique.

What’s the output of the following program? Why?

#include
main()
{
typedef union
{
int a;
char b[10];
float c;
}
Union;
Union x,y = {100};
x.a = 50;
strcpy(x.b,\”hello\”);
x.c = 21.50;
printf(\”Union x : %d %s %f \n\”,x.a,x.b,x.c );
printf(\”Union y :%d %s%f \n\”,y.a,y.b,y.c);
}
Given inputs X, Y, Z and operations | and & (meaning bitwise OR and AND, 
respectively)
What is output equal to in

output = (X & Y) | (X & Z) | (Y & Z)

Why are arrays usually processed with for loop?

The real power of arrays comes from their facility of using an index 
variable to traverse the array, accessing each element with the same 
expression a[i]. All the is needed to make this work is a iterated statement
in which the variable i serves as a counter, incrementing from 0 to a.
length -1. That is exactly what a loop does.

What is an HTML tag?

An HTML tag is a syntactical construct in the HTML language that abbreviates
specific instructions to be executed when the HTML script is loaded into a 
Web browser. It is like a method in Java, a function in C++, a procedure in 
Pascal, or a subroutine in FORTRAN.

What problems might the following macro bring to the application?

#define sq(x) x*x

Anything wrong with this code?
T *p = new T[10];
delete p;

Everything is correct, Only the first element of the array will be deleted”
, The entire array will be deleted, but only the first element destructor 
will be called.

Anything wrong with this code?
T *p = 0;
delete p;

Yes, It’s an attempt to delete a null pointer.

How do you decide which integer type to use?

It depends on our requirement. When we are required an integer to be stored 
in 1 byte (means less than or equal to 255) we use short int, for 2 bytes we
use int, for 8 bytes we use long int.
A char is for 1-byte integers, a short is for 2-byte integers, an int is 
generally a 2-byte or 4-byte integer (though not necessarily), a long is a 4
-byte integer, and a long long is a 8-byte integer.

What’s the best way to declare and define global variables?

The best way to declare global variables is to declare them after including 
all the files so that it can be used in all the functions.

What does extern mean in a function declaration?

Using extern in a function declaration we can make a function such that it 
can used outside the file in which it is defined.
An extern variable, function definition, or declaration also makes the 
described variable or function usable by the succeeding part of the current 
source file. This declaration does not replace the definition. The 
declaration is used to describe the variable that is externally defined.
If a declaration for an identifier already exists at file scope, any extern 
declaration of the same identifier found within a block refers to that same 
object. If no other declaration for the identifier exists at file scope, the
identifier has external linkage.

What can I safely assume about the initial values of variables which are not
explicitly initialized?

It depends on complier which may assign any garbage value to a variable if 
it is not initialized.

What is the difference between char a[] = “string”; and char *p = “string
”;?

In the first case 6 bytes are allocated to the variable a which is fixed, 
where as in the second case if *p is assigned to some other value the 
allocate memory can change.

What’s the auto keyword good for?

Answer1
Not much. It declares an object with automatic storage duration. Which means
the object will be destroyed at the end of the objects scope. All variables
in functions that are not declared as static and not dynamically allocated 
have automatic storage duration by default.
For example
int main()
{
int a; //this is the same as writing “auto int a;”
}

Answer2
Local variables occur within a scope; they are “local” to a function. They
are often called automatic variables because they automatically come into 
being when the scope is entered and automatically go away when the scope 
closes. The keyword auto makes this explicit, but local variables default to
auto auto auto auto so it is never necessary to declare something as an 
auto auto auto auto.

What is the difference between char a[] = “string”; and char *p = “string
”; ?

Answer1
a[] = “string”;
char *p = “string”;

The difference is this:
p is pointing to a constant string, you can never safely say
p[3]=’x’;
however you can always say a[3]=’x’;
char a[]=”string”; C character array initialization.
char *p=”string” ; C non-const pointer to a const-string.( this is 
permitted only in the case of char pointer in C++ to preserve backward 
compatibility with C.)

Answer2
a[] = “string”;
char *p = “string”;
a[] will have 7 bytes. However, p is only 4 bytes. P is pointing to an 
adress is either BSS or the data section (depending on which compiler ― GNU
for the former and CC for the latter).

Answer3
char a[] = “string”;
char *p = “string”;

for char a[]…….using the array notation 7 bytes of storage in the static 
memory block are taken up, one for each character and one for the 
terminating nul character.
But, in the pointer notation char *p………….the same 7 bytes required, plus
N bytes to store the pointer variable “p” (where N depends on the system 
but is usually a minimum of 2 bytes and can be 4 or more)……

How do I declare an array of N pointers to functions returning pointers to 
functions returning pointers to characters?

Answer1
If you want the code to be even slightly readable, you will use typedefs.
typedef char* (*functiontype_one)(void);
typedef functiontype_one (*functiontype_two)(void);
functiontype_two myarray[N]; //assuming N is a const integral

Answer2
char* (* (*a[N])())()
Here a is that array. And according to question no function will not take 
any parameter value.

What does extern mean in a function declaration?

It tells the compiler that a variable or a function exists, even if the 
compiler hasn’t yet seen it in the file currently being compiled. This 
variable or function may be defined in another file or further down in the 
current file.

How do I initialize a pointer to a function?

This is the way to initialize a pointer to a function
void fun(int a)
{
}
void main()
{
void (*fp)(int);
fp=fun;
fp(1);
}

How do you link a C++ program to C functions?

By using the extern “C” linkage specification around the C function 
declarations.

Explain the scope resolution operator.

It permits a program to reference an identifier in the global scope that has
been hidden by another identifier with the same name in the local scope.

What are the differences between a C++ struct and C++ class?

The default member and base-class access specifiers are different.

How many ways are there to initialize an int with a constant?

Two.
There are two formats for initializers in C++ as shown in the example that 
follows. The first format uses the traditional C notation. The second format
uses constructor notation.
int foo = 123;
int bar (123);

How does throwing and catching exceptions differ from using setjmp and 
longjmp?

The throw operation calls the destructors for automatic objects instantiated
since entry to the try block.

What is a default constructor?

Default constructor WITH arguments class B { public: B (int m = 0) : n (m) {
} int n; }; int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { B b; return 0; }

What is a conversion constructor?

A constructor that accepts one argument of a different type.

What is the difference between a copy constructor and an overloaded 
assignment operator?

A copy constructor constructs a new object by using the content of the 
argument object. An overloaded assignment operator assigns the contents of 
an existing object to another existing object of the same class.

When should you use multiple inheritance?

There are three acceptable answers: “Never,” “Rarely,” and “When the 
problem domain cannot be accurately modeled any other way.”

Explain the ISA and HASA class relationships. How would you implement each 
in a class design?

A specialized class “is” a specialization of another class and, therefore,
has the ISA relationship with the other class. An Employee ISA Person. This
relationship is best implemented with inheritance. Employee is derived from
Person. A class may have an instance of another class. For example, an 
employee “has” a salary, therefore the Employee class has the HASA 
relationship with the Salary class. This relationship is best implemented by
embedding an object of the Salary class in the Employee class.

When is a template a better solution than a base class?

When you are designing a generic class to contain or otherwise manage 
objects of other types, when the format and behavior of those other types 
are unimportant to their containment or management, and particularly when 
those other types are unknown (thus, the genericity) to the designer of the 
container or manager class.

What is a mutable member?

One that can be modified by the class even when the object of the class or 
the member function doing the modification is const.

What is an explicit constructor?

A conversion constructor declared with the explicit keyword. The compiler 
does not use an explicit constructor to implement an implied conversion of 
types. It’s purpose is reserved explicitly for construction.

What is the Standard Template Library (STL)?

A library of container templates approved by the ANSI committee for 
inclusion in the standard C++ specification.
A programmer who then launches into a discussion of the generic programming 
model, iterators, allocators, algorithms, and such, has a higher than 
average understanding of the new technology that STL brings to C++ 
programming.

Describe run-time type identification.

The ability to determine at run time the type of an object by using the 
typeid operator or the dynamic_cast operator.

What problem does the namespace feature solve?

Multiple providers of libraries might use common global identifiers causing 
a name collision when an application tries to link with two or more such 
libraries. The namespace feature surrounds a library’s external 
declarations with a unique namespace that eliminates the potential for those
collisions.
This solution assumes that two library vendors don’t use the same namespace
identifier, of course.

Are there any new intrinsic (built-in) data types?

Yes. The ANSI committee added the bool intrinsic type and its true and false
value keywords.

Will the following program execute?
void main()
{
void *vptr = (void *) malloc(sizeof(void));
vptr++;
}

Answer1
It will throw an error, as arithmetic operations cannot be performed on void
pointers.

Answer2
It will not build as sizeof cannot be applied to void* ( error “Unknown 
size” )

Answer3
How can it execute if it won’t even compile? It needs to be int main, not 
void main. Also, cannot increment a void *.

Answer4
According to gcc compiler it won’t show any error, simply it executes. but 
in general we can’t do arthematic operation on void, and gives size of void
as 1

Answer5
The program compiles in GNU C while giving a warning for “void main”. The 
program runs without a crash. sizeof(void) is “1? hence when vptr++, the 
address is incremented by 1.

Answer6
Regarding arguments about GCC, be aware that this is a C++ question, not C. 
So gcc will compile and execute, g++ cannot. g++ complains that the return 
type cannot be void and the argument of sizeof() cannot be void. It also 
reports that ISO C++ forbids incrementing a pointer of type ‘void*’.

Answer7
in C++
voidp.c: In function `int main()’:
voidp.c:4: error: invalid application of `sizeof’ to a void type
voidp.c:4: error: `malloc’ undeclared (first use this function)
voidp.c:4: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each
function it appears in.)
voidp.c:6: error: ISO C++ forbids incrementing a pointer of type `void*’
But in c, it work without problems

void main()
{
char *cptr = 0?2000;
long *lptr = 0?2000;
cptr++;
lptr++;
printf(” %x %x”, cptr, lptr);
}Will it execute or not?

Answer1
For Q2: As above, won’t compile because main must return int. Also, 0×2000
cannot be implicitly converted to a pointer (I assume you meant 0×2000 and
not 0?2000.)

Answer2
Not Excute.
Compile with VC7 results following errors:
error C2440: ‘initializing’ : cannot convert from ‘int’ to ‘char *’
error C2440: ‘initializing’ : cannot convert from ‘int’ to ‘long *’
Not Excute if it is C++, but Excute in C.

In C++, what is the difference between method overloading and method 
overriding?

Overloading a method (or function) in C++ is the ability for functions of 
the same name to be defined as long as these methods have different 
signatures (different set of parameters). Method overriding is the ability 
of the inherited class rewriting the virtual method of the base class.

What methods can be overridden in Java?

In C++ terminology, all public methods in Java are virtual. Therefore, all 
Java methods can be overwritten in subclasses except those that are declared
final, static, and private.

What are the defining traits of an object-oriented language?

The defining traits of an object-oriented langauge are:
* encapsulation
* inheritance
* polymorphism

Write a program that ask for user input from 5 to 9 then calculate the 
average

int main()
{
int MAX=4;
int total =0;
int average=0;
int numb;
cout<<”Please enter your input from 5 to 9″;
cin>>numb;
if((numb <5)&&(numb>9))
cout<<”please re type your input”;
else
for(i=0;i<=MAX; i++)
{
total = total + numb;
average= total /MAX;
}
cout<<”The average number is”<return 0;
}

Assignment Operator C What is the diffrence between a “assignment operator
” and a “copy constructor”?

Answer1.
In assignment operator, you are assigning a value to an existing object. But
in copy constructor, you are creating a new object and then assigning a 
value to that object. For example:
complex c1,c2;
c1=c2; //this is assignment
complex c3=c2; //copy constructor

Answer2.
A copy constructor is used to initialize a newly declared variable from an 
existing variable. This makes a deep copy like assignment, but it is 
somewhat simpler:
There is no need to test to see if it is being initialized from itself.
There is no need to clean up (eg, delete) an existing value (there is none).
A reference to itself is not returned.

“mutable” Keyword C What is “mutable”?

Answer1.
“mutable” is a C++ keyword. When we declare const, none of its data 
members can change. When we want one of its members to change, we declare it
as mutable.

Answer2.
A “mutable” keyword is useful when we want to force a “logical const” 
data member to have its value modified. A logical const can happen when we 
declare a data member as non-const, but we have a const member function 
attempting to modify that data member. For example:
class Dummy {
public:
bool isValid() const;
private:
mutable int size_ = 0;
mutable bool validStatus_ = FALSE;
// logical const issue resolved
};
bool Dummy::isValid() const
// data members become bitwise const
{
if (size > 10) {
validStatus_ = TRUE; // fine to assign
size = 0; // fine to assign
}
}

Answer2.
“mutable” keyword in C++ is used to specify that the member may be updated
or modified even if it is member of constant object. Example:
class Animal {
private:
string name;
string food;
mutable int age;
public:
void set_age(int a);
};
void main() {
const Animal Tiger(a?Fulffya?,’antelope
a?,1);
Tiger.set_age(2);
// the age can be changed since its mutable
}

RTTI C What is RTTI?

Answer1.
RTTI stands for “Run Time Type Identification”. In an inheritance 
hierarchy, we can find out the exact type of the objet of which it is member
. It can be done by using:
1) dynamic id operator
2) typecast operator

Answer2.
RTTI is defined as follows: Run Time Type Information, a facility that 
allows an object to be queried at runtime to determine its type. One of the 
fundamental principles of object technology is polymorphism, which is the 
ability of an object to dynamically change at runtime.

STL Containers C What are the types of STL containers?

There are 3 types of STL containers:
1. Adaptive containers like queue, stack
2. Associative containers like set, map
3. Sequence containers like vector, deque

Virtual Destructor C What is the need for a?Virtual 
Destructor?

Destructors are declared as virtual because if do not declare it as virtual 
the base class destructor will be called before the derived class destructor
and that will lead to memory leak because derived classa?
s objects will not get freed.Destructors are declared virtual so as to bind 
objects to the methods at runtime so that appropriate destructor is called.

Differences of C and C++
Could you write a small program that will compile in C but not in C++?

In C, if you can a const variable e.g.
const int i = 2;
you can use this variable in other module as follows
extern const int i;
C compiler will not complain.

But for C++ compiler u must write
extern const int i = 2;
else error would be generated.

Bitwise Operations C Given inputs X, Y, Z and operations | and & (meaning 
bitwise OR and AND, respectively), what is output equal to in?
output = (X & Y) | (X & Z) | (Y & Z);




============================================================================
=======================================================

1.      Will the following program execute?void main()
{
void *vptr = (void *) malloc(sizeof(void));
vptr++;
}

Compile error. Cannot convert from int to char*.



2.      How about this one?
void main()
{
char *cptr = 0X2000;
long *lptr = 0X2000;
cptr++;
lptr++;
printf(” %x %x”, cptr, lptr);
}Will it execute or not?

Compile error as the sizeof operator cannot be used with void. And we cannot
get the size of size of void*, so vptr++ also produce compile error.



3.      When the processor wakes up after power on, it goes to a particular 
memory location. What is that memory location called?

Wossit got to do with C++?



processor goes to MBR (master boot record) then i takes the address of boot 
loader form thr and execute this boot loader program



4.      What is the difference between Mutex and Binary semaphore?

From Multithreaded Applications in Win32, by Jim Beveridge ( page 93 ):
“…it turns out that a mutex is a degenerated form of a semaphore. If you 
create a semaphore and set the maximum count to one, you get mutual 
exclusion behavior. therefore a mutex is often refered to as a binary 
semaphore…In Win32, the ownership semantics of how the two operate are 
quite different, so they cannot be used interchangeably…”



Mutex is efficent than semaphore. Also unlocking of mutex can be done by the
thread which owns the lock. Not the case with semaphore.



5.      Write a program to set 2nd bit in a 32 bit register with memory 
location 0×2000?

By “2nd bit” are you counting from most significant or least significant 
bit? Anyway, the answer is platform-dependent and compiler-dependent. 
Assuming you have a typedef “uint32″ that is exactly 32 bits long, then 
try something like *reinterpret_cast(0×2000) = 0×40000000 (for 2nd msb) or
= 2 (for 2nd lsb)



6.

void main()

{

printf("%d\n");

printf("%d %d\n");

printf("%d %d %d\n");

}

Output:

0

0 309590428

0 309590428 2147348480



Why this?



7.

void main()

{

int *p = 0;//0 is NULL

delete p;

}

NO error and warning.
