电面imo.im被问到的2个题目，45分钟，都需要写代码出来，结果是挂了。
问题二略微有点变态！

问题一
Subsequences
------------

You're given a large string T. And a stream of smaller string S1, S2, S3 ...

Determine whether Si is a subsequence of T.

|T| < 10 000 000
|Si| < 100
alphabet is 'a' - 'z'

T = abcdefg
S1 = abc        yes
S2 = ag          yes
S3 = ga          no
S4 = aa          no

--------------


问题二
Rectangles
----------

their is a window of size WxH contains Number of existing rectangles with 
given (xi, yi, wi, hi).
Where to place a new rectangle with dimensions w, h such that the sum of the
overlapping area with existing rectangles is minimized.

* all current rectangles fit fully in the window
* place new window fully inside
* no existing windows overlap (but the new one may ovelap when you place it)

W,H < 10 000
N -- number of windows < 100
xi, yi, wi, hi, w, h -- no limitations other than fitting in the screen.
