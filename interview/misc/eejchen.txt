关于string的，是否用DP，请指教
Consider an arbitrary string made up of N digits 0-9, e.g., S="01703406777".
What's an efficient algorithm to figure out if there exists any digit D in 
the string that has 3 occurrences with equal gaps in the string, i.e., in 
the example string S, D=0 occurs at 1st (from left), 4th and 7th positions 
in the string. Also, 7 occurs (with 0 gap) in the last 3 positions. You only
need to find one set of 3 positions for the digit in the string.
