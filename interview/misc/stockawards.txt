May, June店面，on-site过一些公司:box, quantcast, samsung information system 
america, castlight health, storm8, yelp, pocketgem, facebook, palantir, cox 
digital solutions, linkedin等等。只拿到两个鸡肋offers.其余全挂了。

July还有几个on-site/phone interviews,有dream companies.如果搞不定的话，就休
息一下，年底再试。

一些我碰到的，leetcode OJ上没有的题.

1. Hadoop job for matrix multiplication. How to map? How to reduce?
2. Given a known function f(x), where x is in range [0,1] (continuous). f(x)
returns an integer. Ask for a random function g, which returns a uniformly 
random number X (consider the distribution of f(x)).
3. Maximum continuous sub-array product. 
4. Given an array of integers, all numbers appear three times except one. 
Find this unique number.
5. Find the longest path in a tree (could be from any two nodes).
6. Given human input address (in various format), how to identify two inputs
are the same address.
7. Design a mobile app for contacts. Need to sync the contacts with the 
server.
8. In a train route map (like the nyc subway), some routers share part or 
all railway. Express train may skip some stations. For any two stations, 
find the train with lowest fare and the train with the minimum stop.
