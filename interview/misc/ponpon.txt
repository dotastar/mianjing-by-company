最近面了一些矿工/码工的职位，结果都是惨败而归。感觉好多时候都已经走到了最后
一步，结果还是失败了，实力和运气总有一样差那么一点点。今天把一些不太常见的题
发出来，希望对大家有帮助。同时也为今天的面试求祝福，发40个包子。


1. Generate Fibonacci number without iteration and recursion



2. Given two functions
vector<lock_id> has_ID(thread_id) // give a thread_id, return all locks it 
currently has
vector<lock_id> want_ID(thread_id) // give a thread_id, return all locks it 
is waiting

and a set of thread_ids, how do you determine if there is a deadlock in the 
system



3. Complexity of solving a system of linear equations. How many floating 
point operations per clock cycle is a modern CPU (say intel core-i series) 
capable of? Use this to give an order of magnitude estimate of the running 
time of solving a system of linear equations with given size (say n = 1000).



4. Why is entropy defined as E_p[log(p)]. The interviewer drew sketches of 
several distributions and asked which one has the largest entropy (don't 
need to compute explicitly).


5. Given large samples (x_i, y_i) of a pair r.v. (X, Y), can you come up 
with some quick and dirty way to determine if X and Y are independent 
without resorting to estimate joint/marginal pdf.


6. Implement Newton's method


7. Given pairs of related IDs, e.g. (ID_1, ID_2), (ID_2, ID_6), (ID_4, ID_3)
, implement a function which returns all related IDs for any input ID. Note 
that the relationship is transitive. 
E.g.
input: ID_6
output: ID_1, ID_2

input ID_4
output: ID_3



8. How to estimate probability density function given random samples. If you
answer histogram, then how to determine the number of bins. And the pdf 
should be smooth, what should you do after computing the histogram?


9. Find median for an infinite stream of numbers.  You can do it 
approximately, but state your assumption.


10. How to prove that geometric mean is no greater than arithmetic mean?


11. Design a way to generate a fair coin when you can toss a biased coin, 
with prob(H) = p, for n (n is large, say n > 1000) times. How many fair coin
toss can you make out of it?
