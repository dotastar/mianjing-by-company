一个小时的电面，问了很多问题

1.resume
1.1 think of a time that you learn very deeply into a technology. how you 
learned it and what result you get
1.2 think of a time that you are facing a choice of which technique to use 
and how you solved it
1.3 anything you could do differently in any of your projects if you do it 
again.

2. basic data structure
2.1 stack vs queue
2.2 hashtable/dictionary
2.3 tree traversal algorithms and what data structure to use

3. coding 
给个circular list， return the longest sequence that doesn't contain 
duplicate elements

前面扯的太多了，到coding时就剩下20分钟，最后勉强做完，看了一眼立马发现bug，
但没时间改就大概讲了下。等消息了。。。
