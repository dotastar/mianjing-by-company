PS1: 1. Merge sorted linked lists; 2. Iterative inorder traversal of 
binary tree
PS2: 1. Inorder successor of binary search tree; 
onsite: 1. infix expression evaluation of integers and + - * /; 2. 
implement a system to route packets based on their priority; implement 
associative container Map; 3. Given n nodes, each node has 2 blocking 
functions: send(int to_id, int msg); recv(int from_id); each node has a 
value; design a method to distribute the sum of all values on every node to 
all nodes; 4. power. design a Amazon product page chat service so that 
people browsing on the same product page can chat with each other.

onsite: 1. Flatten a binary tree; 2. implement a big integer's 
addition; with addition, minus, multiplication implemented, implement 
division; 3. combination sum, design a battleship game; 4. implement reader-
writer lock with mutex and conditional variable.

PS1: 1. power; other misc staff
PS2: 1. intersection of sorted lists; 2. merge multiple sorted 
lists; 3. how to accelerate the merging of sorted lists (parallelism)
Onsite: 1. design indexing method of increasing but not necessarily
consecutive sequence numbers, each sequence number associated with memory 
address; 
2. given a function of get_connection(int uid
), implement find_1_hop(), find_2_hop(), find_3_hop(); 3. implement delayed 
scheduler: Future schedule(int target_time, Runnable task); 4. design Amazon
's product page, with user info, recommendation and product information, 
include the details of the data storage; 5. given a linked list with struct 
node { node* up, node* down, node* prev, node* next}, assuming no cycles, 
flatten the linked list; 6. Roman to integer, integer to roman.

onsite: 1. what is TCP sliding window; 2. in an array starting with 1
's (consecutively) and following with 0's, find the boundary of 1's; 3. 
design a distributed games with consistent interaction between players, the 
game is assumed on a 2D plane; 4. Given multiple printers on a grid map, 
find the location to place papers such that the sum of distance from the 
paper to all printers is minimal; note that there are obstacles in the grid 
map. What if there is no obstacles? 5. Quick selection, and how to optimize 
on multi-core machines.

onsite: skyline
